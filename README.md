## 🎮 **Diversifiers**

| Title | Description |
| :-- | :-- |
| 🌍 **Living Environment** | The world itself behaves like an organism. |
| 💉 **Contagious Compassion** | The player spreads the parasite to help others — for a price. |
| ☠️ **Kindness Corrupts** | Good intentions bring terrible outcomes. |
| 🧠 **Empathy Test** | Decide who — or what — is truly the parasite. |

## 📖 **Story**

The world is **toxic** — spores saturate the air.  
Only the **parasite** lets humans survive long enough to escape.  
But each infection strengthens its grip.

**The tension:**  
- 🩸 Infect others → save them temporarily → grow the hive.  
- 💊 Use antidote → free them (or yourself) → risk death from exposure.

| 🧫 **Infection Bar** | Tracks player’s parasite level. |
| 🧍‍♂️ **Follower Infection States (1–3)** | NPCs evolve as infection deepens. |
| 💉 **Antidote System** | Suppresses infection temporarily. |
| ☣️ **Toxic Environment** | Constant threat; survival pressure. |
| 🕸️ **Host Link Network** | Shared control across infected hosts. |
| 🔚 **Endgame Choice** | Decide the parasite’s fate — and yours. |

## 🔁 **Gameplay Loop**

### **1️⃣ Survive the Toxic World**
- Infection timer constantly rising.  
- Uninfected NPCs suffocate quickly.

### **2️⃣ Infect or Cure**
- Infect survivors to protect them.  
- Use antidotes sparingly — resources are scarce.

### **3️⃣ Rescue and Command**
- Infected followers can **Follow**, **Stay**, or **Defend**.  
- Balance survival and control.

### **4️⃣ Confront the Hosts**
- Each Host controls nearby infected.  
- Kill them to weaken the parasite’s reach.

### **5️⃣ The Final Choice**
- You are the final Host.  
- 🩸 **End the infection** — die as a savior.  
- 👁️ **Complete the hive** — live as the parasite.
