## Theme
Parasitims

## Diversifiers
Living Environment - The world itself behaves like an organism  
Contagious Compassion - The player spreads the parasite in attempts to help others  
Kindness Corrupts - Good intentions bring bad outcomes  
Empaty Test - The player must choose who truly is the parasite in the end  


## Story
The world is toxic — spores saturate the air. The parasite is the only thing that keeps humans alive long enough to escape.
But the more people you infect, the stronger the parasite becomes… and the more control it takes.  

The tension:  
- Infect others → save them temporarily → spread the hive.  
- Use antidote → free them (or yourself) → risk death from exposure.

### Core Systems
Infection Bar (Player)  
Follower Infection States (1–3)  
Antidote System  
Toxic Environment  
Host Link Network  
Endgame Choice  


### Gampeplay Loop
1 - Survive the toxic world:  
- Player infection timer ticking up.
- Uninfected NPCs suffocate without help.

2 - Infect or Cure:  
- Infect survivors to shield them from the air.
- Use antidote sparingly to hold infection at bay.

3 - Rescue and Command:  
- Infected survivors can follow you, fight, or guard zones.
- You can command them (Follow, Stay, Defend).

4 - Confront Hosts:
- Each Host controls infected nearby.
- Kill them to weaken the parasite’s grip.

5 - Final Choice.
- You realize you’re the final Host.
- Kill yourself → end infection.
- Stay alive → complete the hive.
